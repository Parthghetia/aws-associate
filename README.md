# AWS-ASSOCIATE
## Known terms to be used
- EC2 - A compute instance
- Lambda - Used to provide serverless application architecture. That means that network events like consumer requests can trigger the execution of a pre-defined code-based operation
- Elastic Beanstalk - managed service by AWS. All you need to do is to push your application code and AWS does the rest for you

### Networking terms to be used
- VPC - Used to secure, isolate and configure network environments around your instances
- Direct Connect - Can be used to establish an enhanced direct tunnel between your local data center and your AWS based VPCs
- Route 53 - AWS DNS service that lets you manage domain registration
- CloudFront - Amazons distributed global CDN. When configured properly this can store cached versions of your site's content at edge locations across the world

### Storage terms to be used
- S3 - inexpensive object storage
- S3 glacier - good choice for when you need larger data archives stored cheaply over long term and can live with retrieving delay in hours
- Elastic Block Store - provides persistent virtual storage drives that host the OS and working data of an EC2 instance. Meant to mimic the storage drives and partitions attached to physical servers
- Storage Gateway - hybrid storage system that exposes AWS cloud storage as a local, on premises appliance

### DB terms to be used
- Relational Database Service - managed service that builds you a secure, stable reliable DB instance
- DynamoDB - used for fast flexible and scalable managed nonrelational (NoSql) DB workloads

### Application Management terms to be used
- Cloud watch - to monitor process performance and resource utilization and when thresholds are met to send messages and etc
- CloudFormation - enables you to use template files to define full and complex AWS deployments. Scripting basically
- CloudTrail - collects records of all your API events. 
- Config - to help with change management and compliance of your AWS account (Define a base config - if the config moves away from that. you get notified)


### Security and identity terms to be used
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) - for user access and auth to your AWS account
- Key Management Service - administer creation and use of encryption keys to secure data used by AWS resources
- Directory Service - For integration with other identity providers like AD

### Application integration terms to be used
- Simple Notification Service (SNS) - automate alerts to other services (e.g to trigger a lambda function) or SMS
- Simple Workflow - lets you coordinate a series of tasks that must be performed using AWS services or even non-digital events
- Simple Queue Service - event-driven messaging within distributed systems that can decouple while coordinating the discrete step of the larger process. The data contained in your SQS messages will be reliably delivered, adding to the fault tolerant qualities of an application
- API Gateway - to create and manage secure and reliable APIs for your AWS based applications

### Basic commands to create an S3 bucket using AWS CLI

```
aws s3 ls
aws s3 mb s3://mybucket --region us-west-1
aws s3 cp test s3://test-parth-123
aws s3 rb s3://test-parth-123 --force
```

### Provisioning an EC2 instance

An AMI is really just a template that has information telling EC2 what OS and application software to include on the root data volume

Four kinds of AMIs:
1. Amazon quick start AMIs - self
2. Marketplace AMIs - prod ready images
3. Community AMIs - indendepently created stuff
4. Private AMIs - own stuff

AMIs is only available in one region. if you invoke the ID of an AMI from a different region it will fail

There are many instance types to suit your needs. Feel free to browse them here:
aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types

### Configuring an environment for your instance

Three things to get right when configuring your instance:
Geographical region, VPC config and tenancy model

- A good idea to separate/create a new VPC for each of your project or project strages like different VPCs for early app dev another for beta testing etc
- Tenancy - can be shared or dedicated - shared means you could share the server with other customers and opposite for dedicated. Costs will be obvio ....
